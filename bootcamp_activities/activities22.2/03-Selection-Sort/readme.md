**selectionSort.js**

Instructions:

Using the below approach as a guide, implement the "Selection Sort" in JavaScript.

* Scan through the list and find the smallest number possible. This requires looping through and checking which number is greater than 0, but smaller than all other numbers.
* We would then say that this is our first number.
* We would then loop through and check which number is bigger than this smallest number, but smaller than any other number.
* This would then be our second number.
* And so onâ€¦

Then, test your algorithm with each of the commented out arrays of data. 

> As a bonus, use Benchmark.js to time it in both cases.
