# Chris' Component Review

In this activity we will create a new card and have it display after the original card. It can be an entirely new card, or a duplicate of the first. 

## Instructions

* Copy the Existing Component called Card, Rename and reference in the App.js file after the original Card.
* This is a bootstrap dependent application, so you will need to include the CDN in the index.html
