# TypeScript Resources



**TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that gives you advantages like:**

- Optional static typing (the key here is optional)
- Type Inference, which gives some of the benefits of types, without actually using them
- Access to ES6 and ES7 features, before they become supported by major browsers
- The ability to compile down to a version of JavaScript that runs on all browsers
- Great tooling support with IntelliSense

### React

React is based on JavaScript ES6+ combined with JSX script. JSX is an extension for syntax, which makes a JavaScript code resemble that written in HTML. This makes the code easier to understand, and typos are easier to spot. For the JSX code to be compiled in a browser, React is augmented with Babel â€“ a code translation tool.

### Angular

Angular can use JavaScript or TypeScript, which is a superset of JS developed specifically for larger projects. TypeScript is more compact than JavaScript, the code is easier to navigate, and typos are easily spotted. Code refactoring process also becomes simpler and faster.
